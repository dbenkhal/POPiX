This directory contains scripts to build the test application using
OCaml.

- To download OCaml:
   http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/      

- One must build the OCaml library before compiling the example.
  Go to directory ../ocaml

- Use 'build.cmd' to build the test application using OCaml compiler.

Remark: The Microsoft C compiler tool chain must be in your path,
or you can use the Visual Studio Command Prompt.

- The script 'exec.cmd' adds the bin directory to the path. So,
test_mlapi.exe can find z3.dll.
