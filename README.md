POPIX a precision tuning framework  with the new functionality of generating fixed- point formats. It returns solutions suitable â€“ at bit-level â€“ for the IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic, the fixed-point arithmetic, and the MPFR library for non-standard precision.


## :bulb: Features
 - Analyzes a program written in an IMP language and annotated with the precision desired by the user on the output
 - Produces an under-approximation of the ranges of the variables by dynamic analysis
 - Generates and solves an ILP problem based on a semantic modelling of the numerical errors propagation  
 - Finds the minimal number of bits needed at bit-level and in floating-point arithmetic with an accuracy guarantee on the result
 - Internally calls a fixed-point library to convert the associated indications into ones that exploit fixed-point computations

## :wrench: Prerequisites

To use POPiX, you must install the following dependencies:

- JAVA SE version 19 or latest 
- The following jar Files :
 - [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) generator parser version 4.7.2 or latest
 - [GLPK](https://glpk-java.sourceforge.net/gettingStarted.html) solver version 4.65 or latest 
 - [FixMath](http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/fixmath/)  Library version 1.4 (User manual ðŸ”— https://www.nongnu.org/fixmath/doc/index.html)
